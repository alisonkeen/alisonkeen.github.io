        <p>In case anyone's curious what I have been working on... the short answer is 'OpenAustralia SA'. The long answer is as follows...</p>

<p>No occasional care available so no block of computer time</p>

<p>Interstate visiting family, no chance to do much</p>

<p>Blackouts the night before meant no coding due to two kids home from school and occasional care. </p>

<p>While the toddler was in care (morning, 90mins): </p>

<ul>
<li>looked up why <a href="https://github.com/Henare" class="user-mention">@Henare</a> 's federal Bills scraper is erroring and decided to ignore it for now - the arguments needed to make the URL work are really NOT scraper friendly!!</li>
<li>Attempted to fix the bugs in my own scraper so it exports CSV that can be imported straight into OpenAustralia's codebase. Members one seems to be working now?</li>
<li>Morph.io/ruby/popolo issue: I discovered that you can't output 'group' as a column in the data item to sqlite3 from ruby. Something doesn't like it. Need to look up another name... </li>
<li>Created the skeleton of a parser on Morph to build a Mechanize scraper - to grab available Hansard transcript dates. While I was there got distracted. In the SA Hansard search-page source it clearly had a form to subscribe to alerts ... but it took five minutes of hunting to find a small "create an alert" link down the bottom of the page. </li>
</ul>

<p>While he was asleep in the afternoon: </p>

<ul>
<li>Created this, as a way of keeping track of progress </li>
<li>I can't find the parser to convert ausparl XML to openaustralia XML. I can't even remember the right names for the schema, I don't remember where it was, but I'm sure I saw one a few weeks ago!?</li>
</ul>

<p>Created three more nokogiri scrapers tweaked from the first one which match the input format for OpenAustralia closely enough that I managed to get it to import the list of MPs. Only to discover I needed three lists - a general 'members' one with almost no info, a 'senators' one and a 'representatives' one. </p>

<p>Got them working by emptying the 'ministers' and 'shadow-ministers' csv files - the ministerial portfolios need to be parsed and written into, as well. Given this is auxiliary info, it can wait until after I have a basic grip on Mechanize. The section/line control needed to handle the start/end dates and portfolio info available on the members' pages is a bit fiddly.</p>

<p>Finally plucked up the courage to knuckle down and learn how Morph works, and write my first scraper. You know... I think I might actually really like Morph, partly for the way the output APIs all Just Work... :D</p>
