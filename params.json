The long answer is as follows...\r\n \r\n### Thur 22-9-2016\r\n\r\nWhile the toddler was in care (morning, 90mins): \r\n- looked up why @Henare 's federal Bills scraper is erroring and decided to ignore it for now - the arguments needed to make the URL work are really NOT scraper friendly!!\r\n- Attempted to fix the bugs in my own scraper so it exports CSV that can be imported straight into OpenAustralia's codebase\r\n- discovered that you can't output 'group' as a column in the data item to sqlite3 from ruby. Something doesn't like it. \r\n- created the skeleton of a parser on Morph to build a Mechanize scraper to grab available Hansard transcript dates, and while I was there got distracted. In the SA Hansard search-page source it clearly had a form to subscribe to alerts, but it took five minutes of hunting to find a small \"create an alert\" link down the bottom of the page. \r\n\r\nWhile he was asleep in the afternoon: \r\n- created this, as a way of keeping track of progress \r\n\r\n\r\n### Thurs 15/9\r\n\r\nCreated three more nokogiri scrapers tweaked from the first one which match the input format for OpenAustralia closely enough that I managed to get it to import the list of MPs. Only to discover I needed three lists - a general 'members' one with almost no info, a 'senators' one and a 'representatives' one. \r\n\r\nGot them working by emptying the 'ministers' and 'shadow-ministers' csv files - the ministerial portfolios need to be parsed and written into, as well. Given this is auxiliary info, it can wait until after I have a basic grip on Mechanize. The section/line control needed to handle the start/end dates and portfolio info available on the members' pages is a bit fiddly.\r\n\r\n### Thur 8/9\r\n\r\nFinally plucked up the courage to knuckle down and learn how Morph works, and write my first scraper. You know... I think I might actually really like Morph, partly for the way the output APIs all Just Work... :D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
